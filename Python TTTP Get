#HTTP GET request in Python

import requests

# Define the URL
url = "https://api.example.com/data"

# Send the GET request
# response = requests.get(url)

# Check the response status
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the response content
    data = response.json()  
#   If the response is in JSON format
    print(data)
else:
    print(f"Request failed with status code
 {response.status_code}")
```
### Explanation:
1. **Install `requests`:** If you don’t already have it installed, you can use the command `pip install requests` in your terminal or command prompt.
2. **HTTP GET Request:** The `requests.get(url)` function sends a GET request to the specified URL.
3. **Response Handling:** You can access the response's content using `.text`, `.json()` (for JSON data), or `.content` (for binary data).
4. **Status Code:** Always check `response.status_code` to ensure the request was successful (e.g., `200 OK`).
